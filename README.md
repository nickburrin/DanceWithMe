# DanceWithMe
This repository is for a EE 464 senior design project at the University of Texas. 
DanceWithMe is an Adroid mobile application that pairs potential dance partners based on similar style and skill.
The matching mechanism is very similar to dating apps such as Tinder, Bumble.
Our backend database was built using Parse MBaaS, which was acquired by Facebook and disabled in 2017. Thus this application will no longer work. 
The app was inspired by our advisor Dr. Evodokia Nikolova, who is an avid Latin dancer. She encouraged us to apply the principles of the stable marriage problem to a user friendly application
